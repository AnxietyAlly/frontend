# Frontend Repository README

This repository primarily focuses on the frontend of our application. For this project, an application has been developed with the theme of anxiety at its core. The purpose of this application is to determine whether the user experiences any form of anxiety. This is achieved through a quiz with questions. The user logs in, takes the quiz, and receives a result. Additionally, the application includes features such as venting to an AI robot, participating in forum chats, reading articles about various forms of anxiety, and completing a daily checkup. The user can fill out this daily checkup to assess their well-being on a day-to-day basis. These data are stored privately and securely for the user's access to review.

This repository is also connected to other repositories. For instance, there is a backend repository responsible for the backend of this application. You can find these applications within this project.
